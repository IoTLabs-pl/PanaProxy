## ℹ️ What is PanaProxy?

PanaProxy is a physical device that runs `panasonic_aquarea` from IoTLabs Components. It gives you full control and monitoring of Panasonic Aquarea heat pumps through:
- 📱 Web interface (on the device)
- 🏠 Home Assistant integration (automatic discovery)

Your device comes **pre-loaded and ready to use** – no code or flashing needed. Plus, firmware updates happen automatically – you never need to worry about keeping it current.

## ⚙️ Advanced Users: Customizing the Firmware

If you want to modify the firmware (add sensors, automations, change behavior, etc.), use **Adopt** in ESPHome Dashboard.
> ⚠️ **Remember that once you adopt the device, it will no longer receive managed firmware updates and you will be responsible for maintaining your custom firmware, syncing with ESPHome Core updates, etc.** If you want to return to the managed firmware, you will need to re-flash the factory firmware on your device.

### How to Adopt & Customize

1. **Open ESPHome Dashboard**
2. **Click "Take Control"** on the device
3. **Edit your device config** - add/modify settings as needed
4. **Save & Upload**
